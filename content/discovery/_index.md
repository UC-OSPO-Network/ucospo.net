The UC OSPO Network is embarking on an ambitious initiative to map and analyze the open source landscape across the University of California system.
Building upon existing efforts like the NumFOCUS Map of Open Source Science (MOSS), the Apereo Foundation's Open Source Software in Higher Education Report, and Open@RIT's Mystic Community Health Analytics System, our project team will develop tools to identify and catalog open source projects and research groups throughout the UC campuses.
This comprehensive mapping effort will serve as a crucial interface between the UC research enterprise and the broader open source community, informing UC-wide open source strategies and policies.
To achieve this, we will conduct system-wide surveys to assess open source projects, practices, and perceptions, followed by the creation of a detailed map of UC-led open source projects and their dependencies.
This valuable information will guide our outreach activities and help curate a portfolio of open source projects primed for external engagement.
Our initiative necessitates the development of infrastructure capable of discovering UC-associated open source projects and analyzing their communities and software artifacts.
