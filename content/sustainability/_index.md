The UC OSPO Network recognizes the critical role of open-source software (OSS) in modern research and education.
As researchers increasingly rely on and contribute to OSS, its sustainability has become paramount for the entire scientific community.
This issue resonates across all UC campuses, prompting our project team to address the challenges of OSS maintenance and develop strategies to overcome them.
We aim to establish best practices for the UC system—which can serve as a model for other large university systems—focusing on building robust community architectures, increasing adoption, and enhancing project security.
By tackling these key areas, we strive to ensure the long-term viability and impact of open-source projects originating from and utilized within the UC system.
