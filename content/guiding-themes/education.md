The UC OSPO Network’s Education initiative builds upon the substantial training materials and courses already developed by participating UC campuses and the larger open source ecosystem. By coordinating these efforts through our network and leveraging insights gained from our discovery activities, we are working to create and share materials that are particularly relevant and impactful for the UC system.

## Projects

### Open Educational Resource

Creation of an open educational resource (OER) containing curriculum modules covering contribution practices, community engagement, sustainability, licensing, and security. Following collaborative lesson development principles, modules are being developed as living community resources with continuous improvement by contributors. Our development uses Carpentries methodology (backward lesson design, formative assessment) and Carpentries Workbench infrastructure, with trial teaching informing refinement. Modules will be published with DOIs, maintained through open contribution processes, and released periodically with contributor recognition. Deployment through UC Carpentries enables system-wide reach via 60+ trained instructors. This effort will leverage UC Carpentries' existing coordination infrastructure and centralized resource discovery mechanisms, ensuring OSPO curriculum integrates with established system-wide educational pathways serving 2,000+ annual UC learners.

This resource is being built using a comprehensive five-phase curriculum framework, learner profiles, and lesson inventory with over 50 lessons tagged with Bioschemas metadata. It will be available on the OC OSPO Network’s website and will provide users with the opportunity to focus on specific questions and issues they may have.

### Training and hackathons

Helping lead wider deployment of open source curriculum at UC campus workshops and hackathons, system-wide events like _UC Love Data Week_, and other venues. Through the UC Carpentries + OSPO partnership, the Network will also deliver up to five joint workshops integrating Carpentries pedagogy with OSPO topics (e.g. contributor onboarding, sustainable software practices, licensing). Building on UC Carpentries' coordination infrastructure, workshops and expanded programming can be adapted for different audiences and environments.
