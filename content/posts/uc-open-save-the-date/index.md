## SAVE THE DATE - 2025 UC Open

**April 23 & 24, 2025**
**Venue: [UCSC Silicon Valley Campus](https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/)**

The UC Open celebrates open source efforts throughout the UC system and provides an opportunity to highlight the valuable and impactful research happening at our campuses. This event will include UC faculty, technical staff, and students, as well as those interested in collaborating with the UC open source community, and focus on sharing experience, knowledge, and expertise.

The event will take place over two days in the centrally located UCSC Silicon Valley Campus (short drive to San Jose and San Francisco Airports.)
The event will include keynotes, panels, directed discussions and technical sessions covering a wide range of issue relevant to open source communities inside and outside academia. Special attention will be given to common challenges facing open source communities in the UC-system.

**Check back soon for registration information and the full agenda!**

*For those coming from outside the Bay Area, information for discounted hotel rates will be available soon.*
