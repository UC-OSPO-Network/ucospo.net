Open Source Software (OSS) powers everything from academic research to mission-critical infrastructure at tech giants. Yet, over **90% of OSS projects experience stagnation or abandonment**. The question is no longer whether OSS matters, but _how to ensure its sustainability_.

## Meet OSSPREY

**<a href="https://oss-prey.github.io/OSSPREY-Website/" target="_blank">OSSPREY</a> (Open Source Software PRoject sustainabilitY tracker)** is an intelligent, modular, and research-backed platform that enables open source maintainers to anticipate and address project health issues before they become critical. Developed by the Davis Excellent/Eclectic/Extreme Computational Analytics Lab (<a href="https://decallab.cs.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">DECAL Lab</a>) at UC Davis, OSSPREY uniquely combines real-time GitHub data scraping, socio-technical network modeling, machine learning forecasting, and a curated knowledge base of interventions grounded in software engineering research.

The OSSPREY paper has also been accepted in the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/ase-2025/ase-2025-tool-demonstration-track" target="_blank">Automated Software Engineering 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</a>.

By analyzing both technical contributions (e.g., commits, file changes) and social signals (e.g., issue discussions, collaboration patterns), OSSPREY delivers comprehensive month-by-month sustainability forecasts. What truly sets it apart is its **ReACT (Researched ACTionable) recommendation engine**, which maps empirical research findings to tailored, actionable strategies maintainers can deploy to counteract emerging risks‚Äîsuch as declining contributor activity, fragmented communication, or stagnant issue resolution.

> ‚ÄúOSSPREY bridges the gap between academic sustainability metrics and real-world decision making by providing both forecasts and evidence-based recommendations.‚Äù

## Why OSSPREY Matters

Traditional metrics like issue count or commit frequency don‚Äôt tell the full story. OSSPREY moves beyond snapshots and offers:

- **Real-time monitoring** of GitHub projects using socio-technical networks.
- **Month-by-month sustainability forecasts** powered by a transformer model with 94% F1-score accuracy.
- **Actionable ReACTs** ‚Äî evidence-based interventions curated from 186 empirical studies.
- **Interactive network visualizations** showing communication and technical dependencies.

## How It Works

OSSPREY‚Äôs pipeline includes four key modules:

- **Scraper:** Rust-based module collects commits, issues, and metadata monthly via GitHub GraphQL API.
- **Network Generator:** Builds social and technical networks to map collaboration and file ownership.
- **Forecaster:** Transformer model forecasts future sustainability based on historical network features.
- **ReACT-Recommender:** Suggests empirically validated strategies when sustainability dips.

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Forecast Graph:** Visualizes project sustainability with branching future scenarios (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Actionables Panel:** Ranks interventions by impact level and relevance. Each is linked to peer-reviewed research.
- **Social + Technical Network:** View developer interaction and technical load distribution via interactive Sankey charts.
- **Project Metadata:** Stargazers, forks, sponsors, contributor trends, and more contextual insights.

## Who Should Use OSSPREY?

If you're a **maintainer, community manager, OSS foundation lead, or software engineering researcher**, OSSPREY gives you the tools to understand and shape the future of your project ‚Äî not just respond to symptoms after it‚Äôs too late.
