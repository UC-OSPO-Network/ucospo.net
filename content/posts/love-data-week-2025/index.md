## Open Source and Open Data at UC

[UC Love Data Week](https://uc-love-data-week.github.io/) is an annual event that brings together students, researchers, and staff to explore data practices, open science, and research infrastructure across the UC system. This year, I co-led a session on **OSPOs in Higher Ed** with **Stephanie Lieggi (UCSC), Amber Budden (UCSB), and Todd Grappone (UCLA)**, introducing the **UC OSPO Network** and its role in supporting open-source research and software sustainability.

With **15 attendees—many from UC libraries**—we discussed how OSPOs can help researchers and institutions sustain and manage their open-source projects. The session also provided an opportunity to gather feedback on **what researchers need most when it comes to open-source support**.

## The UC OSPO Network

The **UC OSPO Network** is a multi-campus initiative designed to **support open-source initiatives across UC**. Funded by the **Alfred P. Sloan Foundation**, the network includes representatives from **UCLA, UCSD, UCSC, UC Davis, and UC Berkeley**, with ongoing engagement from other campuses.

Our efforts focus on three key areas:

- **Discovery** – Identifying and tracking open-source projects within UC to better understand trends, contributions, and opportunities. Tools like the **UC Open Source Repository Browser (UC ORB)** will help visualize UC’s OSS footprint.
- **Education** – Conducting a **gap analysis** of existing open-source training resources (Carpentries, CodeRefinery, Turing Way, and UC-developed materials) and developing new content to address gaps.
- **Sustainability** – Creating **best practices, governance models, and community-building strategies** to help ensure long-term viability for UC open-source projects.

## Researcher Challenges in Open Source

During the session, we asked attendees:

> **What is the biggest challenge you face in managing, sharing, or sustaining your research data or software?**

Their responses highlighted some of the most pressing issues:

- **Software obsolescence & reproducibility** – _"Thinking of alternatives or reproducibility when older software is sunsetted or datasets are removed."_
- **Instructional materials & sharing barriers** – _"If we use in-house software, I may not always have a tutorial to reference, and I would create my own, but cannot necessarily share it with the larger crowd."_
- **Lack of documentation** – _"There needs to be more of it, and it needs to be better."_
- **Need for qualified instructors** – _"Finding qualified instructors to teach tools and techniques for managing, publishing, and reusing data and software assets."_
- **From research-grade to production-ready software** – _"As a support staff member, I find there's a big activation energy from 'research grade' to really polished software."_

These responses align with the core challenges the UC OSPO Network is working to address.

## OSPOs as a Bridge for Open Source and Open Data

One of the main takeaways from the discussion was the need for **better integration between open-source software and research data services and infrastructure**. OSPOs can play a role in addressing these challenges by:

- Providing **guidance on licensing, governance, and compliance**
- Offering **infrastructure and tools** to support open-source development
- Expanding **training opportunities and workshops** for researchers
- Helping **transition research software into sustainable, reusable tools**
- Connecting open-source initiatives with **libraries and data services**

## What’s Next?

The feedback from Love Data Week reinforced the growing demand for structured **support around open-source software in research**. In the coming months, the UC OSPO Network will:

- Expand **training and educational offerings**
- Strengthen **collaborations between research groups and libraries**
- Improve **documentation and sustainability models**
- Advocate for **UC-wide policies that support open-source software**

## Stay Connected
