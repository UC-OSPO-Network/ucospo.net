This guide accompanies our [LICENSE template](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/templates/blob/d8ba9301beb523c10a7195ddf0fb70a068312022/LICENSE-template.txt). Please refer to these [instructions for using the template](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/templates#how-to-use-the-templates).

All OSS projects need a License Agreement—usually in a file named `LICENSE.TXT`— to establish what's constitutes acceptable use. We've included the BSD 3-Clause license in our template, but this doesn't constitute legal advice and you should check with your campus's Tech Transfer Office to see what the best options are for your project. You can also a list of [UC-approved licenses](https://security.ucop.edu/resources/open-source-software-licensing.html) provided by the UC Office of the President.
