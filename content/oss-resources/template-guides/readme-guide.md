This guide accompanies our [README template](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/templates/blob/d8ba9301beb523c10a7195ddf0fb70a068312022/README-template.md). Please refer to these [instructions for using the template](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/templates#how-to-use-the-templates).

What is your project, and why did you create it? You can help potential users—and contributors, if your project accepts contributions—understand the problem your project solves, and perhaps a bit of why you chose to the solve the problem in this way. This section should be fairly short (you'll go into more detail below). For inspiration, check out [Lazygit's "Elevator pitch" section](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#elevator-pitch). You might also like to include a screenshot of your project in use!

### Features

What are the awesome things your project can do? You don't need to list every feature (though you might, if your project is fairly small!), but you can list the standouts:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What other software would a user need to have installed on their machine in order to use yours? Are there particular concepts they should already be familiar with?

```bash
dependency install command here
```

### Installation

How can users install your software? You might provide different methods for different package managers as well as different operating systems.

```bash
your project's install command
```

### Environment variables (optional)

Perhaps an API is required to run your software, so you might say something like:

To run this project, you'll need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

`API_KEY`

`ANOTHER_API_KEY`

### Running tests (optional)

If tests should be run, you can put the instructIons for that here.

```bash
test command
```

### Run locally (optional)

Perhaps your users will run your project locally:

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone yourprojecturl
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
 cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
install command
```

Start the server

```bash
server start command
```

### Deployment (optional)

How is your software deployed?

```bash
 deployment command
```

## Usage

Use this space to document how to use your project. You might show additional screenshots, code samples, demos or link to other resources. If this section starts getting very long, consider setting up a dedicated wiki or docs site!

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Roadmap (optional)

Both users of and potential contributors to your project are likely to have ideas for possible features to add or other suggestions, and maintaining a roadmap will help keep everyone on the same page about plans for the project. You can [create tables in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables), but you can also keep it simple:

### Backlog

- Research user needs for new product features
- Develop initial product requirements document

### To Do

- Implement core feature set
- Create technical architecture proposal
- Identify key performance benchmarks

### In Progress

- Develop minimum viable product (MVP)
- Set up continuous integration pipeline

### Testing

- Conduct alpha testing
- Perform comprehensive security audits
- Execute performance and load testing

### Staged for Release

- Finalize documentation

### Done

- Validate core product concept
- Conduct user experience interviews

## Contributing (optional)

If you'd appreciate contributions to your project, you might say something like:

Contributions are always welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./contributing-guide.md) for tips to get started.

### Code of Conduct

If you'll be accepting contributions to your project, you'll need to consider how you'll ensure a good experience for you and your contributors.

Please read check out the [Code of Conduct for more detail!](./code-of-conduct-guide.md)

## FAQ (optional)

Any question you've been asked more than once (or suspect you'll be asked more than once!) is a good candidate for an FAQ entry. And if you end up with more than a few FAQ entries, you'll be ready to starting writing dedicated docs (stay tuned for help with that!)

**Question 1**

Answer 1

**Question 2**

Answer 2

## License

Your license file should be in the root of your project's repo, and you can link to it directly like this:

Distributed under the [insert your license name]. See [LICENSE.txt](./license-guide.md) for more information.

## Contact (optional)

It's up to you to decide how you'd like to be contacted with questions about your project! Common methods include:

- Email address
- Social media handle(s)
- Link to your project's forum, Slack channel, Discord server, etc.
- Asking people to open an issue to ask their question

## Attribution (optional)

Use this section to mention useful resources and libraries that you've leaned on in building your project. For example, we're grateful to have built this template with inspiration from:

- [Richard Littauer's Standard Readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)
- [Awesome Readme Template](https://github.com/Louis3797/awesome-readme-template)
