This guide accompanies our [CODE OF CONDUCT template](🚧). Instructions for use (🚧 write after setting up template repo)

Search for the word `TODO` in the template for links that need to be customized. When you finish editing 🚧 the template, remove the `TODO` bits.

All OSS projects need a Code of Conduct (COC) to establish expectations of behavior for all members of the community, and you can either:
- Edit the template we included in our template repo, or
- Delete it and use the wonderful [interactive CoC tool](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopt) by the Contributor Covenant to create a CoC that's customized for your community (with support for over 40 languages!).
