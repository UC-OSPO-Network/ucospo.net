This guide accompanies our [CODE OF CONDUCT template](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/templates/blob/d8ba9301beb523c10a7195ddf0fb70a068312022/CODE_OF_CONDUCT-template.md). Please refer to these [instructions for using the template](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/templates#how-to-use-the-templates).

All OSS projects need a Code of Conduct (COC) to establish expectations of behavior for all members of the community, and you can either:

- Edit the template we included in our template repo, or
- Delete it and use the wonderful [interactive CoC tool](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopt) by the Contributor Covenant to create a CoC that's customized for your community (with support for over 40 languages!).
