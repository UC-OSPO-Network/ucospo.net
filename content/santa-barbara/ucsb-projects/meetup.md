## Join us at the UCSB Open Source Meetup!

The UCSB Open Source meetup is a casual, in-person, monthly meeting where UCSB
students, faculty, and staff can come together over an interest in open source.
All backgrounds and experience levels are welcome. This is a great opportunity
to learn from others and be a part of a larger open source community at UCSB!

All our meetings are on the
[UC OSPO events calendar](https://ucospo.net/events).

Get meetup reminders and our newsletter by

## Meeting format

We meet every two weeks, and we alternate between two formats:

**Standard meetings:** the format is up to the organizer. The organizer may give
a talk about their own project, show their code for code review, facilitate a
group discussion on a topic of interest, or do something else. Meetings are
casual and shouldn't require too much formal preparation.

**"Open Source Lounge":** These are co-working sessions where attendees can work
on their open source goals. Bring your laptop and some work to do such as
documentation cleanup, a bug to work on, or learning exercises to hone your
coding skills.
