## Join us at the UCSB Open Source Meetup!

The UCSB Open Source meetup is a casual in-person meeting where UCSB students,
faculty, and staff can come together over an interest in open source. All
backgrounds and experience levels are welcome. This is a great opportunity to
learn from others and be a part of a larger open source community at UCSB!

[UC OSPO events calendar](https://ucospo.net/events). However, since this method
requires downloading the .ics file, which does not reflect updates, we recommend
using the Google calendar above.

## Meeting format

Starting in 2026, we'll meet every two weeks, and we'll alternate between two
formats:

🙋🏽**Topical Discussions:** the format is up to the organizer. The organizer may
give a talk about their own project, show their code for code review, facilitate
a group discussion on a topic of interest, or do something else. Meetings are
casual and shouldn't require too much formal preparation.

👩🏻‍💻**"Open Source Lounge":** These are co-working sessions where attendees can
work on their open source goals. Bring your laptop and some work to do such as
documentation cleanup, a bug to work on, or learning exercises to hone your
coding skills.

### Logistics

We meet every other Wednesday at noon.

**Topical discussions** are 12-12:50pm on Zoom. (Formerly in room 1312 in the
UCSB Library, our discussions have moved to Zoom for greater accessibility.)

**Open Source Lounge** sessions are 12-2pm and are hybrid format: join us in
room 1411 in the Sara Miller McCune Arts Library (which is inside the UCSB
library), or on Zoom. The lounge sessions are like office hours--come and go as
your schedule allows!
