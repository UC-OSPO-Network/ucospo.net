**Where**: Peter J. Shields Library (room 360) at UC Davis<br>
**Who**: Anyone who writes code for research!

Are you a researcher or student who writes scripts, handles data, or maintains specialized tools? Without realizing it, you might already be part of the open source community! This casual one-hour gathering is designed specifically for scientists, researchers, and academics who code as part of their work but might not necessarily identify as "programmers."

Whether you're a biologist analyzing genomic data, a sociologist processing survey results, or a geologist mapping terrain features, this meetup will show you how your coding skills connect to the broader open source ecosystem. We'll explore how the tools you already use (and perhaps contribute to) fit into the open source landscape, and discuss simple ways to benefit from and participate in this collaborative community.

Join us for refreshments and conversation with others who, like you, use computation to advance their research. No technical expertise required—just register below and bring your curiosity!
