### July

#### All-Campus Virtual Meetup

**When**: Thursday, July 10, 2025 at noon<br>
**Where**: [Zoom link](https://ucdavis.zoom.us/j/94131081913?pwd=TUujo3NUWymYNfbUkiQUeqvfo7FX6y.1)<br>
**Who**: Anyone (including students and staff!)<br>

Join us for the inaugural UC open source contributors & maintainers virtual meetup, bringing together the vibrant open source community across all UC campuses! Whether you're a seasoned maintainer with years of experience or just thinking about starting your open source journey, this collaborative space is designed for learning, sharing, and connecting with fellow UC community members who are passionate about open source software. We'll exchange insights, discuss challenges and successes, discover new projects, and build meaningful connections with peers from across the UC system. This is the first of three annual meetups where we'll celebrate the incredible open source work happening throughout our universities and support each other in growing as contributors and maintainers.

All roles—students, faculty, staff, researchers—and experience levels are welcome, as we believe the best learning happens when diverse perspectives come together.

## Past Events

**UCSB Open Source Meetup**

**When**: Wednesday, Jun 4, 2025 at noon<br>
**Where**: UCSB Library, Room 1411 (in the Sara Miller McCune Arts library)<br>
**Who**: Anyone (including students and staff!)<br>
**Bring**: Your lunch 😋

Are you experienced with open source software or hardware, or just curious about open source? 

In partnership with UC’s new Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Network, the UCSB Open Source Programs Team is starting a casual recurring meetup on June 4th. We'll provide a space where experienced and aspiring open source contributors can learn from one another through casual discussions and talks from guest speakers. This is a lunch-and-learn event, so bring your lunch and we’ll bring cookies!

**Collaborate and Grow: Open Source for Research Coders (Davis)**

**When**: Thursday, May 29 2025 at 3pm<br>
**Where**: Peter J. Shields Library (room 360) at UC Davis<br>
**Who**: Anyone who writes code for research!

Are you a researcher or student who writes scripts, handles data, or maintains specialized tools? Without realizing it, you might already be part of the open source community! This casual one-hour gathering is designed specifically for scientists, researchers, and academics who code as part of their work but might not necessarily identify as "programmers."

Whether you're a biologist analyzing genomic data, a sociologist processing survey results, or a geologist mapping terrain features, this meetup will show you how your coding skills connect to the broader open source ecosystem. We'll explore how the tools you already use (and perhaps contribute to) fit into the open source landscape, and discuss simple ways to benefit from and participate in this collaborative community.

Join us for refreshments and conversation with others who, like you, use computation to advance their research. No technical expertise required—just register below and bring your curiosity!

**OS SlugFest (Santa Cruz)**

**When**: Tuesday, May 27 2025 at 5pm<br>
**Where**: Baskin Courtyard and E2-180 at UCSC<br>
**Who**: Anyone (including students and staff!)

Calling all UCSC Open Source Software enthusiasts! The Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS) and the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) are excited to be holding our second annual Open Source SlugFest (OSSlugFest).

Anyone from the UCSC and Santa Cruz open source community is invited! We ask you to register below so we know how many to expect. Food and beverages will be provided.

Do you want do a lightning talk about what you are working on? We have set aside time to hear from those already working on Open Source projects on campus – let us know if you want a slot when you register.  

We will have representatives from the UCSC OSPO (and other offices) to talk with you about how we can support and promote your open source endeavors. We will end the evening with a raffle for those in attendance!
