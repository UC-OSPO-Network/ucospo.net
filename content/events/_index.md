### All-Campus Virtual Meetup

Whether you're a seasoned maintainer with years of experience or just thinking about starting your open source journey, this collaborative space is designed for learning, sharing, and connecting with fellow UC community members who are passionate about open source software. We'll exchange insights, discuss challenges and successes, discover new projects, and build meaningful connections with peers from across the UC system. This is the first of three annual meetups where we'll celebrate the incredible open source work happening throughout our universities and support each other in growing as contributors and maintainers.

All rolesâ€”students, faculty, staff, researchersâ€”and experience levels are welcome, as we believe the best learning happens when diverse perspectives come together.

### Collaborate and Grow: Open Source for Research Coders (Davis)

**When**: Thursday, May 29 2025 at 3pm<br>
**Where**: Peter J. Shields Library (room 360) at UC Davis<br>
**Who**: Anyone who writes code for research!

Are you a researcher or student who writes scripts, handles data, or maintains specialized tools? Without realizing it, you might already be part of the open source community! This casual one-hour gathering is designed specifically for scientists, researchers, and academics who code as part of their work but might not necessarily identify as "programmers."

Whether you're a biologist analyzing genomic data, a sociologist processing survey results, or a geologist mapping terrain features, this meetup will show you how your coding skills connect to the broader open source ecosystem. We'll explore how the tools you already use (and perhaps contribute to) fit into the open source landscape, and discuss simple ways to benefit from and participate in this collaborative community.

Join us for refreshments and conversation with others who, like you, use computation to advance their research. No technical expertise requiredâ€”just register below and bring your curiosity!
