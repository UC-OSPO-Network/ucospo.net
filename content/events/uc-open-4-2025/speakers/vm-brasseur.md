## Bio

I’ve spent much of my twenty-plus years in the tech industry leading software development departments and teams, providing technical management and leadership consulting for small and medium businesses, and helping companies understand, use, release, and contribute to free and open source software in a way that’s good for both their bottom line and for the community.

I am the author of two books:

1. _Forge Your Future with Open Source_, the first book to detail how to contribute to free and open source software projects. Think of it as the missing manual of open source contributions and community participation. It’s available as [eBook](https://fossforge.com/), [paper book](https://bookshop.org/p/books/forge-your-future-with-open-source-build-your-skills-build-your-network-build-the-future-of-technology-brasseur/6388560?ean=9781680503012), and [audiobook](https://pragprog.com/titles/a-vbopens/forge-your-future-with-open-source/)

2. [_Business Success with Open Source_](https://fossbiz.com/). Free and open source software (FOSS) is the whetstone of the cutting edge. Your company is almost certainly using FOSS right now, whether you know it or not. Discover how to use, contribute to, and release open source projects effectively and strategically for your business with this book.

Both books are published by [The Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com/).

Over the years I’ve founded and lead some useful but non-standard free/open source projects, including the [FOSS Governance Collection](https://fossgovernance.org/) (founder and maintainer), [FLOSS Foundations website and directory](https://flossfoundations.org/) (admin, moderator, and maintainer), and the [Public Speaking Repo](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking). I’m a frequent advisor for FOSS projects and communities, including for national organisations such as [OpenUK](https://openuk.uk/)].

I’m a frequent and popular [public speaker](https://www.vmbrasseur.com/presentations/) and have presented several international keynotes.

Currently I live in lovely Oregon with my amazing cats, [Osgood](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vmbrasseur/tags/osgood) and [Basil](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vmbrasseur/tags/basil/). I am not interested in relocating.
