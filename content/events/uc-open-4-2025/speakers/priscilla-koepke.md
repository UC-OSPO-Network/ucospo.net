[Priscilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscillakoepke/) brings big-tech, startup tech and government experience to The F3 Initiative (Food Farms Future) that was awarded $65 million from the U.S. Economic Development Administration in September 2022 - the largest federal grant ever awarded to California’s Central Valley. As the CEO of F3 Innovate, the non-profit created from this initiative, she is focused on turning the Central Valley into the nation’s hub for agrifood tech and engineering, while positioning the Central Valley’s ag-based industry and farmers to be competitive, resilient, and sustainable. UC Merced, Fresno State, UC Agriculture & Natural Resources (ANR), Go-Biz and California Department of Food & Agriculture sit on her board.
