## Bio

[Colleen’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-josephson-4b3a9216/) work includes designing novel sensing paradigms for agriculture, inventing techniques for ultra-low power communication in indoor sensor networks, and exploiting non-traditional energy sources, such as microbes, for sustainable sensing. The vast majority of the work her group conducts is released in the public domain via [open-source artifacts](https://github.com/jlab-sensing). Colleen has also recently been named Co-Director of the [UCSC Agtech Alliance](https://agtech.ucsc.edu/) to promote inter-disciplinary ethical solutions to tomorrow’s AgTech challenges.
