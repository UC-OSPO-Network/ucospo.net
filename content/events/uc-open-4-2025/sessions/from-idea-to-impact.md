## Description

This panel explores the journey of open source projects born in academic settings, particularly at UC campuses, that achieved significant adoption. Through first-hand accounts from project founders, we'll examine diverse sustainability pathways including commercialization, foundation support, fiscal sponsorship, and integration with existing ecosystems. Panelists will discuss the unique advantages and challenges of university-based open source compared to industry initiatives, and identify concrete actions UC can take to enhance the impact and sustainability of campus-originated projects. Join us to learn from successful academic open source transitions and help shape more effective university support systems.
