## Description

Successful open source projects originating from academic researchers highlight the benefits to be gained from university-based open source projects, for both the university and society. In this session, the panelist will tell their own stories of how the projects they were involved with went from an idea in a university or research setting to a successful and widely adopted open source project. These projects all reached a level of success by taking different paths – showing that there are many avenues for academic researchers to take if they want their projects to have impact.  This session will also look at what universities can do to support these projects.
