title: "Directed Discussion: Supporting Open Source Contributions from UC-affiliated Technologists"
---

**Thursday, April 24 2025**

**2:00-2:50**

A Directed Discussion led by [Shawn DeArmond (UCD)](../speakers/shawn-dearmond.md)

## Description

It is not too much of a stretch to speculate that every UC Affiliate, student, staff, faculty, or really anyone else, uses open source software on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. It's in everything that we do with our computers. It runs the very Internet. It runs most web sites you visit. So then why is it so hard for us to contribute back? This discussion strives to identify barriers, and start building a framework to make the right thing to do, the easy thing.

There will be no formal presentation. We will learn from each other, share ideas, and collaborate on creating best practices for streamlining open source contributions.
