## Description

Historically, within academia, there has always been a push to make academic/research findings open and available to the public.  Yet, there is also a pull to protect the value of intellectual property created to ensure that the university benefits from its work and to ensure continued innovation and research.  This panel explores the balance between these two interests and how open source or open source like licenses may play a role in that balance.
