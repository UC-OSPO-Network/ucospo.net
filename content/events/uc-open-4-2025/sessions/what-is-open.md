## Description

There are many dimensions of openness, and open source means different things in different contexts.
In this panel the speakers will discuss open source software, open (and FAIR) data, open access, accessibility and inclusion, and citizen participation in scholarly communications.
They will share how they came to be working in an open space, and discuss how open source can be misunderstood.
There will be lots of time for questions and discussion with the audience to identify who doesn't see themselves represented in open communities and what would need to change to see themselves belonging.
