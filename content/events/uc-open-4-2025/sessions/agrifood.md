## Description

Over $200 billion of venture capital money has been invested in the agrifood sector over the last decade. There are over 150 dedicated tech incubators, accelerators and venture support organizations around the world dedicated to agriculture. Yet we have yet to solve major challenges related to food production and processing. We need new models of innovation and open innovation is a tool that has been under utilized in a sector with very little profit margin historically. How can we better leverage open software and systems and greater collaboration to meet agriculture’s numerous challenges?
