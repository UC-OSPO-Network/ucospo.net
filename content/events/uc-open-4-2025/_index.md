The University of California Open Summit (UC Open) 2025 will highlight the value open source has to the UC system and how UC contributions are a benefit to open source communities. This event welcomes UC faculty, technical staff, and students, as well as the industry and open source community interested in collaborating with UC researchers. The UC Open aims to leverage participants' experience, knowledge, and expertise in order to increase the impact of the research and education on UC campuses. Our keynotes, panels, directed discussions and technical sessions will cover a wide range of issue relevant to open source communities inside and outside academia.

Special attention will be given to common challenges facing open source communities in the UC-system, and ways that collaborating across sectors can help meet these challenges.

We are also excited to announce that the event will include a special meet & greet and **book signing with [Arun Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunpgupta/)**, author of [_Fostering Open Source Culture: Increase Innovation and Deliver Faster with Open Source_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/979-8-8688-0977-4). A limited number of copies will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Attendees are also welcome to bring their own copy for signing. We are excited to provide this opportunity to connect with the author and gain insights into fostering a thriving open source culture.

This isn't just another professional obligation. UC Open promises to be:

- **Genuinely enjoyable**: we’ve made sure to include breaks long enough to recharge your attention span and have meaningful conversations.
- **Small but mighty**: our deliberately limited capacity means you’ll leave with real relationships, not just business cards. Every conversation matters when you're part of a curated community rather than a sea of strangers.
- **Warmly collaborative**: this conference is for humans, not sales. Whether you're a researcher, maintainer, contributor, or simply curious about open source innovation, you'll find your people here.

_Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors, we are able to make this event **free of charge** for all participants and we will provide a light breakfast and lunch on both days as well as a buffet/reception at the end of the first day._

**Date: 23 & 24 April 2025**

**Location: [UCSC Silicon Valley Campus](https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/facility/) Santa Clara, CA**
