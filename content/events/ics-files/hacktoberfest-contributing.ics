DESCRIPTION:Hacktoberfest is a global October celebration that encourages people to make their first contributions to open source projectsâ€”and this session is here to help you jump in with confidence! If you've been wanting to contribute to open source but don't know where to start\, join us for a supportive workshop where we'll cover the basics together. We'll share strategies for identifying beginner-friendly projects\, understanding community norms\, and navigating the contribution process\, then stick around to help you explore potential projects and take your first steps. No experience required\; just bring your curiosity and any questions you have about getting involved in the open source community!
