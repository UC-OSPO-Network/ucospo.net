## Our Mission

We strive to create a robust, interconnected network of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) throughout the UC system. Our goal is to foster innovation, promote knowledge sharing, and establish best practices for open-source software development and usage.

## Why a Network Approach?

The UC OSPO Network leverages the unique strengths and expertise of each participating campus, resulting in:

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Multiple campuses working together to develop, test, and refine solutions
- **Broader Applicability**: Outcomes that extend beyond individual campuses
- **Shared Resources**: Distributed workload and shared knowledge across network nodes
- **Simultaneous Innovation**: Multiple projects and thematic activities developed concurrently

## Our Impact

As the first system-wide OSPO network in a large university system, we are setting a new standard for open-source initiatives in academia. Our success will:

- Demonstrate the value of a networked approach to supporting open-source
- Serve as a model for other university systems
- Create expectations for widespread adoption of OSPOs in academic institutions

## Key Initiatives

- Developing an open-source repository browser
- Creating curriculum and resource repositories
- Organizing hackathons and competitions
- Promoting open-source sustainability and best practices
