The UC OSPO Network launched in May 2024 enabled by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

## Our Mission

We strive to create a robust, interconnected network of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) throughout the UC system. Our goal is to foster innovation, promote knowledge sharing, and establish best practices for open source software development and usage.

## Why a Network Approach?

The UC OSPO Network leverages the unique strengths and expertise of each participating campus, resulting in:

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Multiple campuses working together to develop, test, and refine solutions
- **Broader Applicability**: Outcomes that extend beyond individual campuses
- **Shared Resources**: Distributed workload and shared knowledge across network nodes
- **Simultaneous Innovation**: Multiple projects and thematic activities developed concurrently

## Our Impact

As the first system-wide OSPO network in a large university system, we are setting a new standard for open source initiatives in academia. Our success will:

- Demonstrate the value of a networked approach to supporting open source
- Serve as a model for other university systems
- Create expectations for widespread adoption of OSPOs in academic institutions

## Key Initiatives

- Developing an open source repository browser
- Creating curriculum and resource repositories
- Organizing hackathons and competitions
- Promoting open source sustainability and best practices
