The UC OSPO Network’s **Discovery Working Group** is creating tools to map out the open source landscape at the University of California and discover research groups creating open source software throughout the system. These activities enable the network to be the interface between the UC research enterprise and the open source world, informing the UC open source strategy and policy. This Working Group is also undertaking a UC-wide stakeholder survey of open source projects, practices and perceptions. This information will be used to target outreach activities and curate a compelling portfolio of open source projects open to engagement with external sponsors.

Primary activities under this Working Group include:

- _UC Open Source Repository Browser (UC ORB)_: This discovery tool will leverage work by the other initiative– including the [Map of Open Source Science](https://map.opensource.science) – and aims to provide a unique research outcome particularly useful to academic OSPOs and UC leadership. UC ORB data will also help attract external stakeholders interested in supporting and contributing to the identified open source research. The UC ORB will base its data collection on campus-specific queries to be used for APIs of repository providers such as GitHub and integrate results with other UC OSPO network programs.
- _Survey of OS Research and Projects_: In addition to the technical methodologies included within UC ORB, this Working Group is undertaking a comprehensive survey to evaluate the current health of UC-based open source projects, and to better understand the support needs of these projects and perceptions of their communities. This collaboration will help form the basis for an OS community of practice and the data gained in these activities will be used for the publication of the annual “State of UC Open Source.”
