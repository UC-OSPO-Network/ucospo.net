The UC OSPO Network's Education initiative builds upon the substantial training materials and courses already developed by participating UC campuses.
By coordinating these efforts through our network and leveraging insights gained from our discovery activities, we aim to tailor and enhance our educational offerings more effectively.
Our project team will utilize existing expertise, connections to trainers and students, and newly acquired knowledge of the open-source landscape to create resources that benefit not only UC campuses but also other institutions.
This collaborative approach allows us to develop training materials that promote diversity and foster effective mentorship opportunities, while ensuring our educational content remains relevant and impactful across the UC system.
