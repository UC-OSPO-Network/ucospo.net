# Guiding Themes

The OSPO network will coordinate multi-campus activities built around three themes identified as critical by all participating campuses:

- [Discovery](discovery.md)
- [Education](education.md)
- [Sustainability](sustainability.md)

While each campus will take part in these piloting activities to a varying degree based on their particular areas of excellence, all campuses can leverage the results of these efforts. These activities are structured to support and feed into each other while expanding the overall outreach and network building. Having multiple campuses participate in these activities also builds generalizability in the produced materials, which allows for easier entry of additional campuses. Project team members from all campuses participating in multiple themes helps ensure a cohesive and sustainable network.
